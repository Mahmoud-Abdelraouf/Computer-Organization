## Course Description

The course delves into the foundational principles of computer hardware description languages, with a focus on computer organization and architecture. It covers topics such as instruction sets, basic data types, addressing modes, memory hierarchy, and various architectural paradigms including pipelined processors, superscalar processors, and more.

## Objectives

- Familiarize students with computer hardware description languages.
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of computer input/output systems and their design principles.
- Introduce the concepts of pipelined architectural techniques used in RISC processors.
- Explore memory technology and its related design principles.
- Train students in designing complex computer bus circuits.
- Guide students in designing a complete processor using hardware description language.
